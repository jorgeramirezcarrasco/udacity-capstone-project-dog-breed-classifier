# Udacity Capstone Project Dog Breed Classifier

Udacity Capstone Project Dog Breed Classifier

## Project Overview

The problem of the proposal is to categorize dog and human images estimating the closer canine's breed. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. From the initial dataset a subset of images will be stored for testing in order to measure the estimations' quality.

## Project Instructions

The code have been developed working with the notebook instances of AWS Sagemaker. Everything is designed to work with the jupyter lab environment pytorch_p36 and make usage of the SageMaker training and endpoint capabilities.

## Datasets

* [Dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). It contains dog images of 133 breeds.
* [Human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). It contains celebrities' images for training a face detector.
